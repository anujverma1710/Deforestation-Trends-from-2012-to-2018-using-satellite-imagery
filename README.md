# Deforestation-Trends-from-2012-to-2018-using-satellite-imagery


<ul>
  <li>Used Spark (MapReduce) to efficiently read the high quality TIFF image data from hdfs. 
Extracted CNN features from the images and applied K-Means in order to locate regions with similar deforestation rates. 
Also, employed regression models to predict the rate of deforestation given the latitude and longitude. 
Analyzed the correlation between deforestation rates and latitude and longitude.
Technologies used - Python, PyTorch, Spark, MapReduce, Hadoop
