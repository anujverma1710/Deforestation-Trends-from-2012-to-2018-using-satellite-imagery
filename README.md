# Deforestation-Trends-from-2012-to-2018-using-satellite-imagery


<ul>
  <li>Used Spark (MapReduce) to efficiently read the high quality TIFF image data from hdfs. </li>
<li>Extracted CNN features from the images and applied K-Means in order to locate regions with similar deforestation rates. </li>
<li>Also, employed regression models to predict the rate of deforestation given the latitude and longitude. </li>
<li>Analyzed the correlation between deforestation rates and latitude and longitude.</li>
<li>Technologies used - Python, PyTorch, Spark, MapReduce, Hadoop</li>
  <li>Used Hadoop Cluster in Google cloud Platform</li>
</ul>
